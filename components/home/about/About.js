              Hey! I'm Alejandro, if you still need to gather that by now.
              I'm a full-stack software developer from California specializing in the backend, primarily Node,
              but I love building with whatever tools are suitable for the job.

              I currently intern for DreamSF on the Pathways to Citizenship initiative.
              I am also part of an advanced practicum building a web app using React,
              Socket-io, and Node with students from Code The Dream.

              I also have a passion for filmmaking and photography, especially shooting 35mm film with my Nikon f-2.üì∏
